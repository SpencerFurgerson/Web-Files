    <p id="hi">Hi there, my name is <strong>Spencer Furgerson!</strong> </p>
    <img src="Assets/Flats-04.png" width="250" alt="">
    <h3 id="major">Major/Minor</h3>
    <p>I am a Senior this year studying <strong>Business Marketing, Computer Science and CTD.</strong></p>
    <p>I've always had trouble deciding between my interests, so I've been doing my best to chase all three.</p>

    <h3>Experience/Interests/Goals</h3>
    <p>I do have a bit of web development experience with html/css, and have done some building within <em>WordPress,</em>
    albeit primarily with page builders like <em>Elementor.</em>
    <p>I am seriously looking forward to filling in the gaps of my knowledge and aquiring new skills to build upon what I already know.</p>
    <p>In my free time I love to watch sports, make things in Adobe and in real life, as well as play some video games here in there.</p>

    <p id="goals"><strong>Later in life I hope to start businesses like:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Creative Collective</li>
      <li>Consumer Food Products</li>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <li>Sports Analytics/Media</li>
    </ul>

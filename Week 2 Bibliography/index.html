      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>The inception of the team</h3>
      <p>The Royals entered the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots. They were founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman. </p>
      <p>The team was established after Stuart Symington, then-U.S. Senator from Missouri, demanded a new franchise for the city after the Athletics moved to Oakland in 1968. </p>
      <p>Since 1973, the Royals have played at Kauffman Stadium.</p>
      <h3>The name</h3>
      <p>In 1968, the team established a contest to name the team that received more than 17,000 ideas. </p>
      <p>A bridge engineer named Sanford Porte from Overland Park, Kansas, won the contest with “Royals” entry. </p>
      <p> The name actually originates from Missouri’s billion-dollar livestock income, as well as Kansas City being the nation’s leading stocker and feeder market and the home of the American Royal parade and pageant. </p>

      <h3>Best All-time Players</h3>
      <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman;line-height:300%"">
        <li><strong>George Brett</strong></li>
        <img src="assets/george.jpeg" style="width:20vw" alt="George Brett"/>
        <p>Brett played 20 years from the Royals from 1973 - 1993, and is pretty unanimously the best Royal ever.</p>
        <li><strong>Brett Saberhagen</strong></li>
        <img src="assets/Brett.jpeg" style="width:20vw" alt="Brett Saberhagen"/>
        <p>Saberhagen is one of the Royals best and most consistent pitchers ever. He was a pivitol player in the first World Series win.</p>
        <li><strong>Salvador Perez</strong></li>
        <img src="assets/Salvy.jpeg" style="width:20vw" alt="Salvador Perez"/>
        <p>My personal favorite Royal, Salvy has caught for the team for nearly a decade, and has only improved with age.</p>
      </ol>

      <h3>World Series Wins</h3>

      <h4>1986</h4>
      <p>The Royals originally fell behind 1-3 in the series against their rival St. Louis Cardinals. That's right, the Cavs weren't the first to do it.
      <p>The team won 6-1 in game 5, and the two teams headed back to Kansas City for game six.
      <p>In game seven, Bret Saberhagen shutout the Cardinals as Kansas City won 11–0, clinching their first World Series title.</p>

      <h4>2015</h4>
      <p>After getting a lucky wildcard entry in 2014, the Royals won their first division title since 1985 and first Central division title ever.</p>
      <p>The Royals bested the Houston Astros in the ALDS, and defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 6 to win the 2015 ALCS and reach their fourth World Series.</p>
      <p>They beat the New York Mets in just 5 games to become the 2015 World Series champions. It was the Royals' first World Series title since 1985, 30 years later.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>The inception of the team</h3>
      <p>Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots, the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman. </p>
      <p>The franchise was established following the actions of Stuart Symington, then-U.S. Senator from Missouri, who demanded a new franchise for the city after the Athletics moved to Oakland, California in 1968. </p>
      <p>Since April 10, 1973, the Royals have played at Kauffman Stadium, formerly known as Royals Stadium.</p>
      <h3>The name</h3>
      <p>In 1968, the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries. </p>
      <p>Sanford Porte, a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, was named the winner for his “Royals” entry. </p>
      <p>His reason had nothing to do with royalty. “Kansas City’s new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouri’s billion-dollar livestock income. </p>
      <p>Kansas City’s position as the nation’s leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant,” Porte wrote. </p>
      <p>The team's board voted 6–1 on the name, with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman, who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him.</p>

      <h3>Best All-time Players</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>George Brett</strong></li>
        <img src="assets/george.jpeg" style="width:20vw" alt="George Brett"/>
        <p>Brett played 20 years from the Royals from 1973 - 1993, and is pretty unanimously the best Royal ever.</p>
        <li><strong>Brett Saberhagen</strong></li>
        <img src="assets/Brett.jpeg" style="width:20vw" alt="Brett Saberhagen"/>
        <p>Saberhagen is one of the Royals best and most consistent pitchers ever. He was a pivitol player in the first World Series win.</p>
        <li><strong>Salvador Perez</strong></li>
        <img src="assets/Salvy.jpeg" style="width:20vw" alt="Salvador Perez"/>
        <p>My personal favorite Royal, Salvy has caught for the team for nearly a decade, and has only improved with age.</p>
      </ol>

      <h3>World Series Wins</h3>

      <h4>1986</h4>
      <p>In the 1985 World Series against the cross-state St. Louis Cardinals, the Royals again fell behind, three games to one.
      <p>After Danny Jackson pitched the Royals to a 6–1 win in game five, the Cardinals and Royals headed back to Kansas City for game six.
      <p>Facing elimination, the Royals trailed 1–0 in the bottom of the 9th inning, when Jorge Orta led off, hitting a bouncing ground ball to Cardinals 1st basemen Jack Clark, who flipped the ball back to pitcher Todd Worrell at first base.
      <p>The ball beat Orta to the bag, but umpire Don Denkinger called him safe, and following a dropped popup by Clark and a pass ball the Royals rallied to score two runs, winning on a walk-off single from pinch hitter Dane Iorg to send the series to game seven.
      <p>In game seven Bret Saberhagen shutout the Cardinals as Kansas City dominated the Cardinals 11–0, clinching their first title in franchise history.[17]</p>

      <h4>2015</h4>
      <p>After earning a wild card entry to the playoffs in 2014, in 2015, the Royals won the franchise's first division title since 1985 and first Central division title ever.</p>
      <p>The Royals faced the Houston Astros in the ALDS. Down 2–1 in the series and trailing 6–2 in the 8th inning of Game 4, the Royals rallied for 5 runs en route to a 9–6 win before Cueto's gem in Game 5 powered the Royals to a second consecutive ALCS.[43] </p>
      <p>The Royals defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 6, to win the 2015 ALCS and earn a trip to face the New York Mets in the 2015 World Series.</p>
      <p>The Royals beat the New York Mets 4 games to 1 to become the 2015 World Series champions.[41] It was the Royals' first World Series title since 1985. The series win was sealed after the Royals beat the Mets 7–2 in the 12th inning of Game 5.</p>
